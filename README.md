# Hospital Monitoring System

## Project Overview

This project is part of an assignment to develop a system for monitoring, archiving, and backing up heart rate data in a hospital using shell scripting and Linux.
The system consists of three primary shell scripts:

1. `heart_rate_monitor.sh`: Continuously records heart rate data.
2. `archive_log.sh`: Archives the recorded heart rate data.
3. `backup_archives.sh`: Moves the archived logs to a designated directory and securely backs them up to a remote server.
